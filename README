FACT (Functions Are Classes Too): A functional/imperative programming language.

FACT is a functional programming language with many imperative aspects. For example, unlike in most functional
programming languages, variables in FACT can change state. The only data type available for creating records
are first-class environments (a.k.a. scopes).

The FACT interpreter consists for a virtual machine (nicknamed `Furlow') and a compiler.
