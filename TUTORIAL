FACT is a function programming language based on the use of first-class environments as the data structure. 

Installation:

FACT has five dependencies:
 * libgmp (GNU Bignum library)
 * libgc (BDW Garbage collector)
 * libedit (known as editline)
 * libtermcap
 * libpthreads

Make sure that each is properly installed before attempting to build FACT. If you don't, you might
get an error message and that's not really fun at all.

To build and install FACT, enter the following three commands in the directory this file is in:
make 
sudo make install

This will build and install FACT in the correct locations.
If there were any error messages printed, then you did something wrong. Or someone else did something
wrong. I don't know for sure, but I bet SOMEBODY fucked up.
